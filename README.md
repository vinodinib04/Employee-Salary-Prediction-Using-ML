## ✨ Key Features

*   **Interactive UI with Glassmorphism:** A stunning and modern user interface built with Streamlit and custom CSS, featuring a "glassmorphism" design for a professional look and feel.
*   **Powerful XGBoost Model:** Utilizes a highly accurate `XGBoost Regressor` model to provide reliable salary predictions.
*   **Dynamic Salary Range Prediction:** Instead of a single value, the app predicts a realistic salary range, better communicating the model's confidence.
*   **Animated & Engaging UX:** Incorporates Lottie animations for a more engaging and responsive user experience.
*   **Model Performance Insights:** Users can view the model's evaluation plot and R² score in a clean, expandable section.
*   **Fully Deployable:** The project is structured with all necessary files (`requirements.txt`, etc.) for seamless deployment on platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.9+
*   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayushanand18/income-predictor.git
    cd income-predictor
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, run the Streamlit app with this command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 The Machine Learning Pipeline

The predictive power of this application comes from a carefully constructed machine learning pipeline.

*   **Algorithm:** `XGBoost Regressor` was chosen for its high performance and robustness.
*   **Features:** The model is trained on the following features:
    - `Age`
    - `Gender`
    - `Education Level`
    - `Job Title`
    - `Years of Experience`
*   **Preprocessing:**
    - Categorical features (`Gender`, `Education Level`, `Job Title`) are encoded using `LabelEncoder`.
    - Numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure the model performs optimally.
*   **Performance:** The model achieved an **R² Score of 94.58%** on the held-out test set, indicating that it explains a very high percentage of the variance in salary data.
*   **Persistence:** The entire pipeline, including the trained model, encoders, and scaler, is saved into a single `salary_predictor.pkl` file using `joblib` for easy and error-free loading during inference.
